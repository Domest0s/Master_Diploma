 \section{Subject of study}
	
	With new requirements for new straw tracker we have important challenge for long straws. It  is related with the fact that straw and wire will be subjected to gravitational and electrical forces and it causes the sagging. Because the straws are oriented horizontally (or almost, in case of stereo views), sagging is expected to cause in most drift tubes a downward deflection, which might be exploited
when applying a correction.

	Undoubtedly the presence of sagging can complicate the data processing stage and somewhat worse accuracy of track reconstruction. Primary question we have to investigate "is acceptable sag-admitting design?" and "What a downgrade of precision for sag-admitting design?".
	
	Results of measurements on prototypes are discussed in Section \ref{sec:Mesurements}.
